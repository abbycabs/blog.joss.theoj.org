JOSS is expanding its editorial board in a few key areas and we're opening this opportunity to the open source research software community at large. If you think you might be interested, take a look at our [editorial guide](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing.html) which describes the editorial workflow at JOSS and also some of the reviews for [recently accepted papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaccepted+). Between these two, you should be able to get a good overview of what editing for JOSS looks like.

Further background about JOSS can be found in our [PeerJ paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/) which summarizes our first year and [my original blog post](http://arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software/index.html) announcing the journal describes the core motivations for starting the journal.

Over the past ~30 months, our [editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) has handled over 500 submissions to JOSS (444 accepted at the time of writing, 84 under review).

### How to apply

We especially welcome applications from prospective editors who will contribute to the diversity of our board.

If you're interested in applying please email me (<arfon.smith@gmail.com>) with the words `"JOSS editor application"` in the title and include:

- A short statement of interest
- Your specialist subject domains/research topics
- Links to any past JOSS reviews you've carried out (not required)
- A summary of your experience with open source software including any links to projects on e.g. GitHub

✨✨✨ **Please submit your applications before the 18th January, 2019.** ✨✨✨

#### Selection process

The [JOSS editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) will review your applications and make their recommendations. Candidates ranking highly will then have a short (~30 minute) phone call/video conference interview with the editor-in-chief(s). Successful candidates will then join the JOSS editorial team for a probational period of 3 months before becoming a full member of the editorial team.

## Changes to the JOSS editorial board

It's been a busy couple of years and so we're making a few changes to our editorial team to help us scale our editorial process.

### Introducing our three new associate editors in chief

[**Lorena A Barba**](http://lorenabarba.com/)  
Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the George Washington University, leading a research group in computational fluid dynamics, computational physics and high-performance computing. Member of the Board for NumFOCUS, a non-profit in support of open-source scientific software.

[**Daniel S. Katz**](http://danielskatz.org/)  
Works on computer, computational, and data research at NCSA, CS, ECE, and the iSchool at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and has a strong interest in studying common elements of how research is done by people using software and data.

[**Kyle Niemeyer**](http://kyleniemeyer.com/)  
Mechanical engineer in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. Computational researcher in combustion, fluid dynamics, and chemical kinetics, with an interest in numerical methods and GPU computing strategies.

### Introducing our editors emeritus

A few of our editors are stepping down from the day-to-day editorial duties at JOSS. [Abigail Cabunoc Mayes](http://acabunoc.github.io/), [Tracy Teal](http://idyll.org/~tracyt/), and [Jake Vanderplas](http://vanderplas.com/) were amongst the earliest members of our editorial team and have been a huge positive influence on JOSS: their input and guidance on the journal as we scoped it in the early days was invaluable. [Thomas Leeper](https://thomasleeper.com/) and [George Githinji](http://virec-group.org/george-githinji) joined us more recently and between them edited nearly 40 JOSS submissions.

We thank Abby, George, Tracy, Jake, and Thomas for all their contributions to JOSS!

_Arfon Smith, Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Open Source Software._
