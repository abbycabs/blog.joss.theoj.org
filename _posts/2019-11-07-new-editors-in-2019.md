2019 has been a big year for JOSS: This year, we've already published 300 papers and are on target to reach ~360 papers by the end of the calendar year. We've substantially improved [our website](https://joss.theoj.org) and made a number of important changes to our editorial team to help us scale further.

In the last 12 months we've issued two calls for new editors (one in [December 2018](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2018/12/call-for-editors) and one in [August 2019](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/08/call-for-editors)), and we've not done a very good job of announcing when new editors join the team so let's fix that...

## Two new associate editors in chief

In the last few months, we've added two associate-editors-in-chief with [Kevin M. Moerman](https://kevinmoerman.org/) and [Kristen Thyng](http://kristenthyng.com/) stepping into these new roles ⚡.

## New editors joining the JOSS team

## Editors retiring from the team

In 2019, a few of our editors have stepped down from editorial duties at JOSS: [Jason Clark](http://www.jasonclark.info/), [Pjotr Prins](http://thebird.nl/), and [Yo Yehudi](http://yo-yehudi.com/) have already retired from the JOSS editorial team and Roman Valls Guimera, [Melissa Gymrek](http://gymreklab.com/), and [Lindsey Heagy](http://lindseyjh.ca/) will be retiring from the team soon. JOSS only works because of the volunteer efforts from our editors and reviewers and we're deeply indebted to them 💖.

We thanks Jason, Pj, Yo, Roman, Melissa, and Lindsey for all of their contributions to JOSS!
