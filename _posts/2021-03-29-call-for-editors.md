JOSS is continuing to grow, and we are looking to add more editors again. We’re especially interested in recruiting editors with expertise in bioinformatics, material science, ecology, machine learning & data science, and the social sciences.

Since our launch in [May 2016](https://www.arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software), our [existing editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) has handled over 1800 submissions (1200 published at the time of writing, 170 under review) and the demand from the community continues to grow. The last three months have been our busiest yet, with JOSS publishing more than one paper per day, and we see no sign of this demand dropping.

Editors at JOSS make a minimum 1-year commitment, with additional years possible by mutual consent. With some of our existing editorial team reaching the end of their terms with JOSS and this increase in submissions, the time is right to bring on another cohort of editors.

### Editing for a journal during a pandemic

After a pause on submissions in early 2020, JOSS has been open for submissions during most of the pandemic. We recognize that making time for volunteer commitments such as JOSS is especially challenging at this time and are [taking steps](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2020/05/reopening-joss) to reduce the load on authors, editors, and reviewers and continually striving to find the right balance between accommodating the very real challenges many of us now face in our daily lives, and providing a service to the research software community.

Editing for JOSS is a regular task, but not one that takes a huge amount of time. JOSS editors are most effective if they are able to check in on their submissions a couple of times per week. Our goal is that a JOSS editor handles about three submissions at any one time making for about 25 submissions per year. 

### Background on JOSS

If you think you might be interested, take a look at our [editorial guide](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing.html), which describes the editorial workflow at JOSS, and also some of the reviews for [recently accepted papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaccepted+). Between these two, you should be able to get a good overview of what editing for JOSS looks like.

Further background about JOSS can be found in our [PeerJ CS paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/), which summarizes our first year, and our Editor-in-Chief’s [original blog post](https://www.arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software), which announced the journal and describes some of our core motivations for starting the journal.

More recently we’ve also written in detail about our commitment to the [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2021/02/JOSS-POSI) the [costs related with running JOSS](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/06/cost-models-for-running-an-online-open-journal), [scaling our editorial processes](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/07/scaling), and talked about the [collaborative peer review that JOSS promotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niRiyaErqwQ).

## Who can apply

We welcome applications from potential editors with significant experience in one or more of the following areas: open source software, open science, software engineering, peer-review, noting again that editors with expertise in bioinformatics, material science, ecology, machine learning & data science, and the social sciences are most needed.

Members of the JOSS editorial team have diverse backgrounds and we welcome JOSS editors from academia, government, and industry. We especially welcome applications from prospective editors who will contribute to the diversity (ethnic, gender, disciplinary, and geographical) of our board. We also value having a range of junior and senior editors. Unfortunately individuals enrolled in a PhD program are not eligible to serve on the JOSS editorial team.

### How to apply

### Thanks to our editors who are stepping down

A few of our editors are stepping down from the day-to-day editorial duties at JOSS. Lorena A Barba (@labarba), Kathryn Huff (@katyhuff), Karthik Ram (@karthik), and Bruce E. Wilson (@usethedata) have been amazing editors to have on the team and we will miss them very much!
