# Call for Editors

We're looking to expand our editoral board in a few key areas and we're opening this opportunity the open source research software community at large. If you think you might be interested, take a look at our [editorial guide](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing.html) which described the editorial workflow at JOSS and also some of the reviews for [recently accepted papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaccepted+). Between these two, you should get a good overview of what editing looks like.

Further background about the journal can be found in our [PeerJ paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/) which summarises our first year as a journal and [my original blog post](http://arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software/index.html) announcing the journal describes the core motivations for starting JOSS.

### How to apply

If you're interested in applying please email me (arfon.smith@gmail.com) with the words "JOSS editor application" in the title and include:

- A short statement of interest
- Your specialist subject domains/research topics 
- Links to any past JOSS reviews you've carried out (not required)
- A summary of your experience with open source software including any links to profiles on e.g. GitHub

#### Selection process

The [JOSS editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) will review your applications and make their recommendations. Candidates ranking highly will then have a short (~30 minute) phone call/video conference interview with the editor-in-chief(s). Successful candidates will then join the JOSS editorial team for a probational period of 3 months before becoming a full member of the editorial team.

## Changes to the JOSS editorial board

Over the past ~30 months, our [editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) has handled over 500 submissions to JOSS (444 accepted at the time of writing, 84 under review). It's been a busy couple of years and so we're making a few changes to our editorial team to help us scale our editorial process.

### Introducing our three new associate editors in chief

**Lorena A Barba**  
Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the George Washington University, leading a research group in computational fluid dynamics, computational physics and high-performance computing. Member of the Board for NumFOCUS, a non-profit in support of open-source scientific software.

**Daniel S. Katz**  
Works on computer, computational, and data research at NCSA, CS, ECE, and the iSchool at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and has a strong interest in studying common elements of how research is done by people using software and data.

**Kyle Niemeyer**  
Mechanical engineer in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. Computational researcher in combustion, fluid dynamics, and chemical kinetics, with an interest in numerical methods and GPU computing strategies.

### Introducing our editors emeritus

A few of our editors are stepping down from the day-to-day editorial duties at JOSS. Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Jake Vanderplas, and Tracy Teal we're amongst the earliest members of the JOSS editorial team and have been a huge positive influence on JOSS: their input and guidance on the journal as we scoped it in the early days was invaluable. Thomas Leeper joined us about 15 months ago and in that time edited over 30 submissions for us. Thomas recently changed jobs and his new work environment makes editing for JOSS impactical.
