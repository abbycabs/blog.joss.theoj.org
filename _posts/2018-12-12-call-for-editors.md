# Call for Editors

We're looking to expand our editoral board in a few key areas and we're opening this opportunity the open source research software community at large. If you think you might be interested, take a look at our [editorial guide](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing.html) which described the editorial workflow at JOSS and also some of the reviews for [recently accepted papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaccepted+). Between these two, you should get a good overview of what editing looks like.

Further background about the journal can be found in our [PeerJ paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/) which summarises our first year as a journal and [my original blog post](http://arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software/index.html) announcing the journal describes the core motivations for starting JOSS.

### How to apply

If you're interested in applying please email me (arfon.smith@gmail.com) with the words "JOSS editor application" in the title and include:

- A short statement of interest
- Your specialist subject domains/research topics 
- Links to any past JOSS reviews you've carried out (not required)
- A summary of your experience with open source software including any links to profiles on e.g. GitHub

#### Selection process

The [JOSS editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) will review your applications and make their recommendations. Candidates ranking highly will then have a short (~30 minute) phone call/video conference interview with the editor-in-chief(s). Successful candidates will then join the JOSS editorial team for a probational period of 3 months before becoming a full member of the editorial team.

## Changes to the JOSS editorial board

Over the past ~30 months, our [editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) has handled over 500 submissions to JOSS (444 accepted at the time of writing, 84 under review). It's been a busy couple of years and so we're making a few changes to our editorial team to help us scale our editorial process.

### Introducing our three new associate editors in chief
