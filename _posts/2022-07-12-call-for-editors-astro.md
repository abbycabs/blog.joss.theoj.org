JOSS is continuing to grow, and we are looking to add more editors with expertise in the area of astronomy & astrophysics.

Since our launch in [May 2016](https://www.arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software), our [existing editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) has handled nearly 1900 submissions (1684 published at the time of writing, 205 under review) and the demand from the community continues to grow. In particular, we have seen an increase in the number of astronomy & astrophysics submissions, beyond the capacity of our current editorial team.

Editors at JOSS make a minimum 1-year commitment, with additional years possible by mutual consent. With some of our existing editorial team reaching the end of their terms with JOSS and this increase in submissions, the time is right to bring new editors on board.

### Background on JOSS

If you think you might be interested, take a look at our [editorial guide](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editing.html), which describes the editorial workflow at JOSS, and also some of the reviews for [recently accepted papers](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaccepted+). Between these two, you should be able to get a good overview of what editing for JOSS looks like.

Further background about JOSS can be found in our [PeerJ CS paper](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.147), which summarizes our first year, and our Editor-in-Chief’s [original blog post](https://www.arfon.org/announcing-the-journal-of-open-source-software), which announced the journal and describes some of our core motivations for starting the journal.

More recently we’ve also written in detail about our commitment to the [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.59349/m5h23-pjs71) the [costs related with running JOSS](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/06/cost-models-for-running-an-online-open-journal), [scaling our editorial processes](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/07/scaling), and talked about the [collaborative peer review that JOSS promotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niRiyaErqwQ).

Of specific interest to this call, we also have [a collaboration with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Journals](https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2018/12/a-new-collaboration-with-aas-publishing) to provide a parallel review for submissions with a significant software component.

## Who can apply

We welcome applications from potential editors with research experience in astronomy and astrophysics, including but not limited to, open source software development for astrophysical simulations, data reduction, or statistical methods.

Members of the JOSS editorial team have diverse backgrounds, and we welcome JOSS editors from academia, government, and industry. We especially welcome applications from prospective editors who will contribute to the diversity (ethnic, gender, disciplinary, and geographical) of our board. We also value having a range of junior and senior editors.

### How to apply

✨✨✨ To apply please fill in this [short form](https://forms.gle/Zjz8HuPJRGQFVurW9) by 31 July 2022. ✨✨✨

### Selection process

The [JOSS editorial team](http://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) will review your applications and make recommendations. Highly-ranked candidates will then have a short (~30 minute) phone call/video conference interview with a current editor. Successful candidates will then join the JOSS editorial team for a probationary period of 3 months before becoming a full member of the editorial team. You will get an onboarding “buddy” from the experienced editors to help you out during that time.
